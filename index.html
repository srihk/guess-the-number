    <h1>Guess the Number</h1>

    <p>
        A number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) was chosen as key to the only door present in the room you have been
        trapped.<br>
        You only have <strong>10</strong> attempts to guess the key.<br>
        For every wrong guess, you will know whether the key is greater or less than your guess.<br>
        Good Luck!
    </p>
